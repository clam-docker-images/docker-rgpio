# docker-rgpio

This repo builds a Docker image that fetches the `lg` source from `Clam-/lg`, builds `rgpiod` and related libraries from source on top of a small Debian `trixie-slim` base, then exposes the `rgpiod` socket interface for remote GPIO access.

It is designed to be buildable directly from a Git URL, for example with `docker buildx build https://github.com/...`.

It is also structured to work with the remote-client deployment model described in `ha-docker-pxe-deploy`: build the image from this Git repository on the Raspberry Pi client, then run it there with explicit `ports`, `devices`, and `env` settings instead of relying on Compose.

## Easy image build and publish

The repo now includes a small `buildx` wrapper plus `make` targets so the normal workflow is a short command instead of a long Docker invocation.

Default target platform:

- `linux/arm64`

Prerequisites:

- Docker CLI installed
- `buildx` available either as `docker buildx` or standalone `docker-buildx`
- A working Docker daemon, or a Docker context that points at a reachable remote daemon
- For cross-building from a non-ARM host, `buildx` emulation support available to Docker

Build an arm64 image into your local Docker image store:

```sh
make image-build
```

Publish an arm64 image to a registry:

```sh
make image-publish IMAGE_REPO=ghcr.io/<owner>/docker-rgpio IMAGE_TAG=latest
```

Build and publish a specific version tag:

```sh
make image-publish IMAGE_REPO=ghcr.io/<owner>/docker-rgpio IMAGE_TAG=2026.03.15
```

The helper script automatically creates and bootstraps a dedicated `buildx` builder named `docker-rgpio-arm64` if it does not already exist.

Supported variables:

- `IMAGE_REPO`: image repository/name, default `docker-rgpio`
- `IMAGE_TAG`: image tag, default `latest`
- `IMAGE_PLATFORM`: target platform, default `linux/arm64`
- `BASE_IMAGE`: base image build arg, default `debian:trixie-slim`
- `LG_REPO`: GitHub repo to build `lg` from, default `Clam-/lg`
- `LG_TAG`: Git tag to build from, default `202603-off-fix`
- `BUILDER_NAME`: override the `buildx` builder name if needed
- `EXTRA_ARGS`: append raw extra flags to `docker buildx build`

If you prefer not to use `make`, the underlying helper is:

```sh
sh scripts/docker-image.sh build
sh scripts/docker-image.sh publish
```

## Assumptions

- The supported target is a Raspberry Pi OS host running Docker on Raspberry Pi hardware.
- The image builds `rgpiod` from the `Clam-/lg` GitHub source tarball on top of a Debian `trixie-slim` base.
- The default build uses `debian:trixie-slim`.
- This still does not make GPIO portable across arbitrary hosts. The container needs Linux gpiochip device nodes from the host, typically `/dev/gpiochip0` and sometimes additional gpiochips depending on the board.

## Upstream source selection

- By default the image downloads the `Clam-/lg` tag `202603-off-fix` and builds it during `docker build`.
- You can switch to another upstream repo or tag without editing the repo by overriding `LG_REPO` and `LG_TAG`.
- Using tags keeps builds reproducible. If you later need a different tag, pass it at build time.

## Build from a GitHub URL

Build directly from the repo URL:

```sh
docker buildx build \
  -t docker-rgpio:latest \
  --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=debian:trixie-slim \
  --build-arg LG_REPO=Clam-/lg \
  --build-arg LG_TAG=202603-off-fix \
  https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git#main
```

The Dockerfile downloads the selected upstream `lg` tag from GitHub, builds it, and installs only the pieces needed to run `rgpiod`.

Override the upstream tag from the outside with either `make` variables or build args:

```sh
make image-build LG_TAG=202604-some-future-fix
```

```sh
docker buildx build \
  -t docker-rgpio:latest \
  --build-arg LG_TAG=202604-some-future-fix \
  .
```

## Home Assistant PXE Docker Fleet

This repository can be deployed either by pulling the published image or by building from Git. The example below now uses the published GHCR image.

Use a `containers` entry like this on the Raspberry Pi client:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "rgpiod",
    "image": "ghcr.io/clam-docker-images/docker-rgpio:latest",
    "env": {
      "RGPIOD_PORT": "8889",
      "RGPIOD_LOCAL_ONLY": "0"
    },
    "ports": [
      "8889:8889"
    ],
    "devices": [
      "/dev/gpiochip0:/dev/gpiochip0"
    ]
  }
]
```

Notes for that add-on model:

- The example above pulls the published image directly from GHCR.
- If you prefer client-side builds on the Pi, you can still use `source.type: git` instead of a published image.
- Add more entries under `devices` if the target board exposes additional gpiochips.
- If you want to restrict access, set `RGPIOD_LOCAL_ONLY=1` or provide `RGPIOD_ALLOWED_IPS`.
- The example JSON is also available in `examples/ha-docker-pxe-deploy.containers.json`.

## Run on a Raspberry Pi OS host

Minimal device mapping:

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name rgpiod \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --device /dev/gpiochip0:/dev/gpiochip0 \
  -p 8889:8889 \
  docker-rgpio:latest
```

If your board exposes more than one gpiochip, pass each needed device:

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name rgpiod \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --device /dev/gpiochip0:/dev/gpiochip0 \
  --device /dev/gpiochip4:/dev/gpiochip4 \
  -p 8889:8889 \
  docker-rgpio:latest
```

## Runtime configuration

Environment variables:

- `RGPIOD_PORT`: TCP port for `rgpiod`. Default: `8889`
- `RGPIOD_LOCAL_ONLY`: set to `1` to disable remote socket access (`rgpiod -l`)
- `RGPIOD_ALLOWED_IPS`: comma-separated allow-list, translated to repeated `rgpiod -n` flags
- `RGPIOD_ACCESS_CONTROL`: set to `1` to enable access control (`rgpiod -x`)
- `RGPIOD_CONFIG_DIR`: optional config directory passed as `rgpiod -c`
- `RGPIOD_WORK_DIR`: optional working directory passed as `rgpiod -w`
- `RGPIOD_SKIP_DEVICE_CHECK`: set to `1` only if you intentionally want to bypass the startup device check

Extra `rgpiod` flags can be passed as container arguments:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  --device /dev/gpiochip0:/dev/gpiochip0 \
  -p 8889:8889 \
  docker-rgpio:latest \
  -n 192.168.1.10
```

## Compose example

The included `compose.yaml` gives you a local Raspberry Pi OS deployment example. For `ha-docker-pxe-deploy`, treat it as reference material only and use the JSON container spec above instead of Compose directly.

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

Override build args or runtime settings through environment variables:

```sh
BASE_IMAGE=debian:trixie-slim LG_TAG=202603-off-fix RGPIOD_ALLOWED_IPS=192.168.1.10 docker compose up -d --build
```

## Security note

By default `rgpiod` allows remote TCP clients. If the service should only be reachable locally or by a small set of clients, set either:

- `RGPIOD_LOCAL_ONLY=1`
- `RGPIOD_ALLOWED_IPS=192.168.1.10,192.168.1.11`
- `RGPIOD_ACCESS_CONTROL=1`
